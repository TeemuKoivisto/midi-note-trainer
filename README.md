# [midi-note-trainer](https://github.com/teemukoivisto/midi-note-trainer)

This is small web app I built for myself to easily practise music notes and such. IMO you really have to drill them down until reading them is as easy as words.

## How to develop locally

You need NodeJS >=16 and pnpm >= 7.

1. `pnpm i`
2. `pnpm setup`
3. `pnpm client`

## Contributing
